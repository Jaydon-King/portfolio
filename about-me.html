		<p>My name is Jaydon King, I am a Senior at Northern Kentucky University. My major is Computer and Information Technology with a focus in Cybersecurity and a minor in Information Security. My interest in IT started in community college and has grown since as time has gone by. 
		I have been heavily interested in Cybersecurity as it is a growing issue in the IT world with more and more sophisticated attacks. My passion is being able to assist in mitigate the risk of a company being attacked or breached. <br>
		I have been interning as a Service Desk Technician for an IT company in Newport, Kentucky. In my time here, I have learned various IT skills like system administration, using WatchGuard Firewalls, Active Directory, and many other. I asisst users on a daily basis and learn 
		new IT skills almost everyday. <br>
		After graduating in December of 2024, my goal is to get into the cybersecurity field and start getting some experience to help further my career. My interest has always been Information Security and seeing how traffic is being transferred.
